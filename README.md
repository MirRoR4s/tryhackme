## 前言

这是我阅读tryhackme文章的一个记录项目（英文），偶尔有几篇谷歌翻译的文章，我仅仅稍润色了一下。

## Pre Security

This learning path will teach you the pre-requisite technical knowledge to get started in cyber security. To attack or defend any technology, you have to first learn how this technology works.

The Pre-Security learning path is a beginner friendly and fun way to learn the basics. Your cyber security learning journey starts here!

No Prior Knowledge
You need no prerequisite to start this pathway! Just enthusiasm and excitement to learn!

### Introduction to Cyber Security

Understand what is offensive and defensive security, and learn about careers available in cyber.

1. [Intro to Offensive Security](https://hackmd.io/40MlnZxvQESKUEMqRLgsXg)
2. Intro to Defensive Security


## Web Fundamentals

The aim of this path is to teach you how to attack web applications. To successfully attack and exploit web applications, you need to understand how they work. The first section (Web Fundamentals) will give you all the pre-requisite knowledge on this. 

The second section (Security Tools) focuses on learning how to use Industry Standard tooling to interact with your targets. 

The third section (Vulnerabilities) covers various vulnerabilities found in web applications today. This section will go over root causes of these vulnerabilities and give you hands on experience on exploiting them.

The final section (Practise Makes Perfect) will help you apply what you've learnt in previous sections.

After completing this path, you should be able to:

- understand how web applications work
- utilise industry standard tooling when attacking web applications
- explain and exploit common web vulnerabilities
- apply this knowledge to other targets (be it within an interview or a professional web applications security assessment)




### Prerequisites

You need a basic understanding of how web applications work to complete this pathway. If you do not already have these prerequisites, complete the [Pre-Security Pathway](https://tryhackme.com/path-action/presecurity/join).

## Cyber Defense

The Cyber Defense path aims to give a broad introduction to the different areas necessary to detect and respond to threats. This path will be looking at the following areas:

- Getting Started
- Threat and Vulnerability Management
- Security Operations and Monitoring
- Threat Emulation
- Incident Response & Forensics
- Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering

Once you complete this path, you should have the fundamental components of detecting and responding to threats in a corporate environment and using these core concepts to build your understanding of more complex topics within this field.

**Note**: This pathway is still under development and more rooms will be added as they become available. 

### Prerequisites

You need a basic understanding of fundamental computing principles and a broad understanding of the different areas of cyber security to complete this pathway. If you do not already have these prerequisites, complete the [Pre-Security Pathway](https://tryhackme.com/path-action/presecurity/join) and [Intro To Cyber Security Pathway](https://tryhackme.com/path-action/introtocyber/join).
